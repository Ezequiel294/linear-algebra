# Bases

This program is designed to perform the Gram-Schmidt process on a set of vectors. The Gram-Schmidt process is a method for orthonormalizing a set of vectors in an inner product space, most commonly the Euclidean space R^n.

The Gram-Schidt process is used to generate an orthonormal basis for a vector space. In linear algebra, a basis is a set of vectors that, in a linear combination, can represent every vector in a given vector space.

## Instructions

1. Run the bases.py script in your Python environment. You can do this by navigating to the directory containing the script and typing python bases.py in your terminal.

2. The program will first ask you to enter the number of vectors. Input the number and press Enter.

3. Next, you will be asked to enter the dimensions of your vectors. Input the number and press Enter.

4. For each vector, you will be asked to enter its elements one by one. After entering each element, press Enter.

5. After all vectors have been entered, the program will perform the Gram-Schmidt process and output the resulting set of orthonormal vectors.
